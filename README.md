# UI-UX-Experiment5

## Aim:

## 1. Identify User Pain Points

Observe users while they interact with similar apps or websites.

List areas where they struggle, get confused, or take longer to complete tasks.

Focus on recurring problems across different users.

Write 1–2 clear UX problem statements using this template:

“[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact].”

Example:

“A user needs a way to order food quickly because too many pop-ups appear during checkout, which results in frustration and order cancellation.”

## 2. Identifying Appropriate Research Methods

Select suitable research methods such as surveys, interviews, usability testing, or diary studies.

Combine both quantitative (numbers, usage data) and qualitative (opinions, feelings) methods for balanced insights.

Choose methods based on project goals and available resources.

Justification:
These methods help understand how users behave, what problems they face, and how design can improve their experience.

## 3. Creating Personas

Use user data or scenarios to represent different types of users.

Personas help designers stay focused on real needs and behaviors.

Include personal goals, habits, frustrations, and motivations.

## 4. Create at Least Two User Personas With

Demographics – Basic details like age, occupation, and location.

Goals – What the user wants to achieve using the product.

Behaviors – How the user interacts with similar apps or websites.

Pain Points – What difficulties or frustrations the user faces.

Motivation – Why the user wants to solve these problems.

## Output:

## UX Project Scenario 1 – Health & Fitness App

## 1. Identifying and Writing Problem Statements

• Users need a way to track their workouts and meals easily because most fitness apps
have too many steps, which results in users giving up after a few days.

• Users need a way to set small and realistic fitness goals because big or unclear targets
feel demotivating, which results in low consistency.

• Users need a way to see progress visually because numbers alone don’t show
improvements clearly, which results in less engagement.

• Users need a way to receive reminders or motivational quotes because they often forget
to log data, which results in incomplete progress tracking.

## 2. Identifying Appropriate Research Methods

• Online Surveys – To understand what features users like or dislike in current fitness
apps.

• User Interviews – To hear real struggles and motivations from users who work out
regularly.

• Competitor Analysis – To compare leading apps like Fitbit or MyFitnessPal and find
gaps.

• Usability Testing – To observe how users perform key actions like logging workouts or
viewing stats.

## 3. Creating Personas

Persona 1 – Rahul (Age 25, IT Employee)

• Demographics: Lives in Chennai, full-time IT job, tech-savvy.

• Goals: Stay fit, build muscle, track workouts quickly.

• Behaviors: Uses fitness apps but skips detailed logging.

• Pain Points: Complex menus and too many features.

• Motivation: Wants to maintain energy and reduce stress.

Persona 2 – Priya (Age 32, Teacher)

• Demographics: Married, moderate tech user.

• Goals: Lose weight, manage healthy eating habits.

• Behaviors: Logs meals manually, checks weekly progress.

• Pain Points: Hard to find simple calorie tracker.

• Motivation: Wants a healthy, confident lifestyle.

## UX Project Scenario 2 – Food Delivery App

## 1. Identifying and Writing Problem Statements

• Users need a way to find nearby restaurants faster because too many filters make the
process slow, which results in user frustration.

• Users need a way to track their food orders easily because order updates are unclear,
which results in confusion and anxiety.

• Users need a way to complete checkout quickly because multiple steps delay the
process, which results in cart abandonment.

• Users need a way to see clear food images and prices because cluttered layouts make
choices harder, which results in longer decision time.

• Users need a way to get helpful error messages because unclear messages cause
repeated mistakes, which results in poor experience.

## 2. Identifying Appropriate Research Methods

• Competitor Analysis – Compare popular apps like Swiggy and Zomato to identify design
strengths and weaknesses.

• Heuristic Evaluation – Use Nielsen’s usability heuristics to find interface and navigation
issues.

• User Interviews – Talk to regular food delivery users to understand real frustrations.

• A/B Testing – Test two design versions to measure which one improves user satisfaction
and conversion.
These research methods help uncover usability problems, user expectations, and design
improvements needed for a smoother food ordering experience.

3. Creating Personas
Persona 1 – Arjun (Age 22, College Student)

• Demographics: Lives in hostel, orders food 3–4 times weekly.

• Goals: Get tasty, affordable food quickly.

• Behaviors: Uses phone; prefers quick checkout.

• Pain Points: Too many ads and payment delays.

• Motivation: Wants fast ordering and easy navigation.

Persona 2 – Kavya (Age 28, Working Professional)

• Goals: Find reliable and healthy food options.

• Behaviors: Reads reviews and tracks orders.

• Pain Points: Difficult navigation and unclear delivery time.

• Motivation: Wants a simple and stress-free food ordering process.

## Result:

The presentation of two different UX scenarios is successfully completed and verified.
